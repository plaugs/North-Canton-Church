              <h2>Our Pastor</h2>
              <p>Gary Plauger is on staff at Hope Christian Fellowship.  Gary and his   wife Monica have been ministering in the North Canton area for over 15   years.  Their two daughters, son-in-law, and granddaughter live in North   Canton.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Heritage</strong><br>
In 1959, a church in Anchorage, Alaska, was founded by a man named Dick   Benjamin. It was called Abbott Loop Christian Center. Through the years,   that church has planted many other churches all over the world. One of   those outreach churches was called C-Street Christian Center, planted in   downtown Anchorage. A few years later, a team was sent out from   C-Street to start a church in Colorado Springs – Colorado Springs   Christian Center. Then still later, a team was sent out from Colorado to   plant Alliance Christian Center in Alliance, Ohio. Our church was sent   out from Alliance Christian Center in December of 1990. Since then we’ve   grown from a small, home-based church with a membership of ten to our   present size.</p>
              <p><strong>Pastor Mike Ross, Our Founding Pastor of East Liverpool</strong><br>
              Mike Ross was saved as a child in a Presbyterian Church. The Lord spoke   to him at this time, giving him a calling and vision for his life. When   Mike was eight, his father died. Mike entered into a time of rebellion   and searching. Through a series of events in his teen years, Mike was   reconciled to God in 1975. He traveled to Anchorage, Alaska, and found   Abbott Loop Christian Center, attending Bible College there. After the   death of his step-father, he returned to Ohio to be with his mother.   Mike met his wife, Karen and they were married in 1980. God directed   them to join Alliance Christian Center in Alliance, Ohio. This was one   of the greater family of churches that had been planted by Abbott Loop   Christian Center. They lived and worked in Alliance for ten years, then   Mike was ordained as a pastor in 1990 and sent to East Liverpool to   begin this church.</p>
